## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r}

library(readr)
```

```{r}
rental_boaters <- read_csv("C:/Users/Colli/OneDrive/Everything/Documents/dcm-better-business/data/rental_boater.csv")
rental_boaters
```

```{r}
rental_boaters <- rental_boaters %>%
  filter(!is.na(rb_number))


```




```{r}
write_csv(rental_boaters,"C:/Users/Colli/OneDrive/Everything/Documents/dcm-better-business/data/rental_boater.csv")
```




```{r}
staff <- read_csv("C:/Users/Colli/OneDrive/Everything/Documents/dcm-better-business/data/staff.csv")
staff

staff <- staff %>% add_row(staff_id  = 6,
                 first_name ="First",
                 middle_initial ="middle",
                 last_name ="last",
